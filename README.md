# Wine-Quality-Prediction_ML-Project
Wine Quality Prediction 🍷
Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction project! This notebook demonstrates how to predict wine quality using various machine learning models. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.


Project Overview 📊

1. Preprocessing 🧹
Cleaned and prepared the dataset.
Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.

3. Data Visualization and Analysis 📈
Explored feature distributions for red and white wines.
Analyzed feature correlations with wine quality.
Used visualizations like bar charts and scatter plots.

5. Wine Quality Binning 🍷🔍
Categorized wine quality into Low, Medium, and High.
Compared feature variations across quality categories.

7. Model Training and Evaluation 🤖
Implemented models: Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Linear Regression.
Compared model performances using accuracy scores.


9. Key Findings 🔍
Volatile Acidity: Strong indicator for red wine quality.
Alcohol Content: Correlates with quality for both wines.
Sulfur Dioxide: Different impacts on red and white wines.


10. Conclusion 🏆
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy.
Recommendations for further fine-tuning and feature engineering.
